# ModExtractor
this tool can extract difference between two folders contents into another folder.

example:
'moded game' with 'orginal game files' to extract 'mod files' and 'deleted.txt' file contain what orginal game files was deleted.

If the file is of the same size but different in Lastwritetime, checksum is compared.
